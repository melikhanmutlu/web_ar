Make all converters and tools platform-aware for Railway deployment

- Fix obj2gltf npx path in app.py (Windows vs Linux)
- Fix FBX2glTF path in fbx_converter.py (Windows .exe vs Linux binary)
- Fix FBX2glTF path in app.py convert_fbx_to_glb function
- All paths now detect platform and use appropriate binary
- Windows: Uses .exe and full paths
- Linux/Railway: Uses binaries without extension from PATH
- This ensures compatibility across development and production environments
