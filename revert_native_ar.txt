Revert to custom AR button - native button was causing downloads

Problem:
- Native AR button was downloading GLB instead of launching AR
- Previous working version used custom AR button with activateAR()
- Native button approach didn't work as expected

Solution:
- Revert to hiding native AR button everywhere
- Keep custom AR button visible on all devices
- Custom button calls modelViewer.activateAR() properly
- This was the working configuration before

Changes:
- Hide model-viewer::part(ar-button) globally
- Remove mobile-specific button hiding
- Custom AR button works on both mobile and desktop
- Falls back to QR modal when AR not supported

Result:
- Back to working AR activation on mobile
- Custom button properly calls activateAR()
- QR modal fallback for desktop
- No more unwanted downloads
