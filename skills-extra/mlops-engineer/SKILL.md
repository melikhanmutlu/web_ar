## Multi-Agent ML Pipeline Orchestration

For complex ML systems, orchestrate specialized roles through these phases:

### Phase 1: Data & Requirements Analysis
1. **Data Engineering**: Design data pipeline -- source audit, ingestion strategy, schema validation (Pydantic/Great Expectations), data versioning (DVC/lakeFS), incremental loading, CDC strategies, storage architecture (raw/processed/feature layers), data quality framework with lineage tracking
2. **Feature Engineering**: Transformation specifications, feature store schema (Feast/Tecton), statistical validation, handling missing data/outliers, algorithm selection, experiment design with A/B testing methodology

### Phase 2: Model Development & Training
3. **Training Pipeline**: Modular training code, hyperparameter optimization (Optuna/Ray Tune), distributed training (Horovod/PyTorch DDP), cross-validation, ensemble strategies
4. **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow/W&B integration, metric logging, artifact management, experiment comparison
5. **Model Registry**: Version control and tagging, model metadata and lineage, promotion workflows (dev -> staging -> prod), rollback procedures
6. **Code Optimization**: Production-ready refactoring, error handling, caching, memory management, comprehensive test suite

### Phase 3: Production Deployment & Serving
7. **Model Serving**: REST/gRPC APIs (FastAPI/TorchServe), batch prediction (Airflow/Kubeflow), stream processing (Kafka/Kinesis), KServe/Seldon Core
8. **Deployment Strategies**: Blue-green for zero downtime, canary with traffic splitting, shadow deployments, A/B testing infrastructure
9. **Kubernetes Infrastructure**: GPU scheduling, HPA/VPA/KEDA autoscaling, Istio service mesh, PVC strategies, Helm charts

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
10. **Model Monitoring**: Prediction accuracy tracking, drift detection (KS test, PSI), concept drift, feature distribution tracking, business KPI correlation
11. **System Observability**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin), log aggregation (ELK/Loki)
12. **Alerting & Automation**: PagerDuty/Opsgenie integration, automated retraining triggers, performance degradation workflows, incident response runbooks
13. **Cost Tracking**: Resource utilization metrics, cost allocation by model/experiment, optimization recommendations

## Pipeline Design Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Each stage independently testable
- **Idempotency**: Re-running stages should be safe
- **Observability**: Log metrics at every stage
- **Versioning**: Track data, code, and model versions together
- **Failure Handling**: Implement retry logic and alerting
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple (data -> train -> deploy), add validation/monitoring, then hyperparameter tuning, A/B testing, multi-model ensembles

## Success Criteria

- < 0.1% data quality issues in production
- < 5% performance degradation before retraining triggers
- 99.9% uptime for model serving
- < 200ms p99 inference latency
- < 1 hour from commit to production
- < 20% infrastructure waste
- Spot instance utilization > 60%
- Automated rollback within 5 minutes
