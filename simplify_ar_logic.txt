Simplify AR activation logic and add ar-status event listener

Problem:
- canActivateAR returning false even on mobile
- Complex mobile detection logic not working
- Too many console logs cluttering output

Solution:
- Remove canActivateAR checks - just try activateAR()
- Add ar-status event listener for better error handling
- Simplify AR button click handler
- Let model-viewer handle AR capability detection
- Show QR modal on any error

Changes:
- Listen to ar-status event for failures
- Direct activateAR() call without pre-checks
- Catch errors and show QR modal as fallback
- Cleaner, simpler code

Result:
- Model-viewer handles AR detection internally
- Better error handling with ar-status event
- Simpler, more reliable code
- QR modal fallback for unsupported devices
