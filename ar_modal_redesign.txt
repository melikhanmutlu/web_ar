Redesign AR modal to match QR modal styling

Changes:
- Remove dark overlay background (no more nested modals)
- Match QR modal's clean white box design
- Center modal with same positioning as QR modal
- Add close button (X) in header like QR modal
- Enlarge QR code from 128x128 to 256x256 pixels
- Use same shadow and border-radius as QR modal
- Consistent padding and spacing
- Remove phone icon, keep it minimal and clean
- Better dark mode support

Result:
- AR modal now looks identical to QR modal
- No more overlapping/nested modal issue
- Larger, easier to scan QR code
- Cleaner, more professional appearance
