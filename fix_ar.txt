Fix AR modal styling and model-viewer AR configuration

Modal Fixes:
- Add proper dark overlay background (rgba(0,0,0,0.75))
- Add backdrop-filter blur for better visual separation
- Fix modal content background (white box)
- Improve QR code container styling
- Better button styling

Model-Viewer AR Fixes:
- Change ar-scale from "auto" to "fixed" for consistent sizing
- Add ar-modes="webxr scene-viewer quick-look" for better compatibility
- Add ios-src for iOS Quick Look support
- Keep ar-placement="floor" for proper placement

These changes ensure:
1. Modal no longer shows model behind it
2. AR viewing works better on mobile devices
3. Model appears at correct scale in AR
