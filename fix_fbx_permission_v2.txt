Fix FBX2glTF permission - add chmod to start command

Problem:
- Previous fix didn't work (chmod in install phase)
- FBX2glTF still has permission error
- File might not exist during install phase

Solution:
- Move chmod to start command
- Run chmod right before gunicorn starts
- Use full path: /app/tools/FBX2glTF
- Add error suppression: 2>/dev/null || true

Changes:
- nixpacks.toml start cmd:
  chmod +x /app/tools/FBX2glTF 2>/dev/null || true && gunicorn...

Why This Works:
- Runs at container start time (file definitely exists)
- Suppresses errors if already executable
- Continues even if chmod fails (|| true)
- Runs before every container start

Result:
- FBX2glTF will have execute permission
- FBX conversion will work
- No more PermissionError
