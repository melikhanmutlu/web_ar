## Data Pipeline Architecture Patterns

### Architecture Selection
- **ETL** (transform before load): Best when transformations are complex and target schema is fixed
- **ELT** (load then transform): Best with powerful data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- **Lambda** (batch + speed layers): When both real-time and batch analytics are needed
- **Kappa** (stream-only): When all data can be modeled as streams
- **Lakehouse** (unified): Combines data lake flexibility with warehouse structure

### Batch Ingestion Best Practices
- Incremental loading with watermark columns
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Schema validation and dead letter queue for invalid records
- Metadata tracking (`_extracted_at`, `_source`)

### Streaming Best Practices
- Kafka consumers with exactly-once semantics
- Manual offset commits within transactions
- Windowing for time-based aggregations
- Error handling and replay capability

### Orchestration Patterns

**Airflow**: Task groups, XCom for inter-task communication, SLA monitoring, incremental execution with `execution_date`, retry with exponential backoff.

**Prefect**: Task caching for idempotency, parallel execution with `.submit()`, artifacts for visibility, automatic retries.

### Transformation with dbt
- **Staging layer**: Incremental materialization, deduplication, late-arriving data handling
- **Marts layer**: Dimensional models, aggregations, business logic
- **Tests**: unique, not_null, relationships, accepted_values, custom data quality tests
- **Sources**: Freshness checks, `loaded_at_field` tracking

### Storage Strategy

**Delta Lake**: ACID transactions, upsert with predicate matching, time travel, Z-order clustering, vacuum.

**Apache Iceberg**: Partition/sort optimization, MERGE INTO for upserts, snapshot isolation, file compaction with binpack.

### Cost Optimization
- Partitioning: date/entity-based, avoid over-partitioning (keep >1GB per partition)
- File sizes: 512MB-1GB for Parquet
- Lifecycle policies: hot (Standard) -> warm (IA) -> cold (Glacier)
- Compute: spot instances for batch, on-demand for streaming, serverless for adhoc
- Query optimization: partition pruning, clustering, predicate pushdown

### Pipeline Example: Minimal Batch
```python
from batch_ingestion import BatchDataIngester
from storage.delta_lake_manager import DeltaLakeManager
from data_quality.expectations_suite import DataQualityFramework

ingester = BatchDataIngester(config={})
df = ingester.extract_from_database(
    connection_string='postgresql://host:5432/db',
    query='SELECT * FROM orders',
    watermark_column='updated_at',
    last_watermark=last_run_timestamp
)
schema = {'required_fields': ['id', 'user_id'], 'dtypes': {'id': 'int64'}}
df = ingester.validate_and_clean(df, schema)

dq = DataQualityFramework()
dq.validate_dataframe(df, suite_name='orders_suite', data_asset_name='orders')

delta_mgr = DeltaLakeManager(storage_path='s3://lake')
delta_mgr.create_or_update_table(
    df=df, table_name='orders',
    partition_columns=['order_date'], mode='append'
)
ingester.save_dead_letter_queue('s3://lake/dlq/orders')
```

## Data Quality Frameworks

### Data Quality Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Example Check |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Completeness** | No missing values | `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null` |
| **Uniqueness** | No duplicates | `expect_column_values_to_be_unique` |
| **Validity** | Values in expected range | `expect_column_values_to_be_in_set` |
| **Accuracy** | Data matches reality | Cross-reference validation |
| **Consistency** | No contradictions | `expect_column_pair_values_A_to_be_greater_than_B` |
| **Timeliness** | Data is recent | `expect_column_max_to_be_between` |

### Great Expectations Patterns
- Build expectation suites covering schema, primary keys, foreign keys, categorical values, numeric ranges, date validity, freshness, and row count sanity
- Use checkpoints with validation actions: store results, update data docs, send Slack notifications on failure
- Integrate into pipeline: validate before writing to production sinks

### dbt Data Tests
- Schema tests in YAML: unique, not_null, relationships, accepted_values
- Custom tests with `dbt-expectations` and `dbt_utils`
- Singular tests for specific business rules (e.g., orphaned records)
- Table-level: recency, `at_least_one`, expression-based

### Data Contracts
- Define contracts with schema, quality rules, SLAs, and ownership
- Specify PII classification and usage terms
- Include freshness and availability SLAs
- Use SodaCL or Great Expectations for contract enforcement

### Quality Pipeline Best Practices
- Test early (validate source data before transformations)
- Test incrementally (add tests as you find issues)
- Alert on failures with monitoring integration
- Version contracts and track schema changes
- Focus on critical columns, don't test everything
- Test relationships across tables, not just in isolation

## Data-Driven Feature Development

### Overview
Build features guided by data insights, A/B testing, and continuous measurement.

### Phase 1: Data Analysis & Hypothesis
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze user behavior, identify patterns, segment users, calculate baselines using analytics tools (Amplitude, Mixpanel, Segment)
2. **Hypothesis Development**: Define success metrics, expected impact on KPIs, target segments using ICE/RICE scoring
3. **Experiment Design**: Calculate sample size for statistical power, define control/treatment groups, plan for multiple testing corrections

### Phase 2: Feature Architecture with Analytics
4. **Feature Architecture**: Integrate feature flags (LaunchDarkly, Split.io), gradual rollout, circuit breakers
5. **Analytics Instrumentation**: Define event schemas, funnel tracking, cohort analysis capabilities
6. **Data Pipeline**: Real-time streaming for live metrics, batch processing for analysis, warehouse integration

### Phase 3: Implementation
7. Implement backend with feature flag checks, event tracking, performance metrics
8. Build frontend with analytics tracking for all user interactions
9. Integrate ML models if applicable with A/B testing between versions

### Phase 4: Launch & Experimentation
10. Validate analytics in staging; test data pipeline end-to-end
11. Configure experiments: start with 5-10% traffic, implement kill switches
12. Gradual rollout: internal -> beta (1-5%) -> gradual increase with anomaly monitoring

### Phase 5: Analysis & Decision
13. Statistical analysis with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, segment-level effects
14. Business impact: actual vs expected ROI, recommendation on rollout/iteration/rollback
15. Post-launch optimization: identify friction points, plan follow-up experiments

### Configuration
```yaml
experiment_config:
  min_sample_size: 10000
  confidence_level: 0.95
  runtime_days: 14
  traffic_allocation: "gradual"
feature_flags:
  provider: "launchdarkly"
monitoring:
  real_time_metrics: true
  anomaly_detection: true
  automatic_rollback: true
```

### Success Criteria
- 100% of user interactions tracked with proper event schema
- Proper randomization, sufficient statistical power, no sample ratio mismatch
- Measurable improvement in target metrics without degrading guardrail metrics
- No degradation in p95 latency, error rates below 0.1%
