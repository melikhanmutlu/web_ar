Problem:
- Custom AR button hidden on mobile
- Native AR button only works on real mobile devices
- Desktop mobile simulation doesn't show native AR button

- Desktop: Shows QR modal
- Mobile simulation: Shows QR modal or tries AR
- Real mobile: Activates AR successfully
- Consistent user experience
