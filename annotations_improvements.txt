     * List of hotspots with delete
   - Actions section (bottom)
     * "Clear All" button

2. Camera Views Implementation:
   
   Save View:
   - Captures camera orbit (theta, phi, radius)
   - Captures field of view (zoom level)
   - Prompts for custom name
   - Stores in cameraViews array
   
   Apply View:
   - Restores camera orbit
   - Restores field of view
   - Smooth transition via model-viewer
   
   Remove View:
   - Deletes from array
   - Updates list display

3. Hotspot Improvements:
   
   Tooltip System:
   - Creates tooltip div on hotspot creation
   - Shows on mouseenter
   - Follows mouse cursor
   - Hides on mouseleave
   - Dark background, white text
   - Max width 200px
   
   Edit Functionality:
   - Click hotspot to edit
   - Prompt for title
   - Prompt for description
   - Updates data attributes
   - Updates hotspots array
   - Refreshes list

4. Clear All Enhancement:
   - Clears hotspots AND camera views
   - Removes tooltip elements
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Complete cleanup

User Experience:

Camera Views Workflow:
```
1. Position camera at desired angle
2. Zoom to desired level
3. Click "Save Current View"
4. Enter name: "Front Detail"
5. View appears in list
6. Later: Click "Front Detail"
7. Camera smoothly moves to saved position
```

Hotspot Workflow:
```
1. Click "+ Add Pin"
2. Pin appears on model
3. Click pin to edit
4. Enter title: "Engine Bay"
5. Enter description: "Check oil level here"
6. Hover over pin → Tooltip shows info
7. Pin visible in list
```

Technical Details:

Camera State Capture:
```javascript
const cameraOrbit = modelViewer.getCameraOrbit();
// Returns: { theta, phi, radius }

const fieldOfView = modelViewer.getFieldOfView();
// Returns: degrees
```

Camera State Restore:
```javascript
modelViewer.cameraOrbit = `${theta}rad ${phi}rad ${radius}m`;
modelViewer.fieldOfView = `${fov}deg`;
```

Tooltip Positioning:
```javascript
tooltip.style.left = (e.clientX + 10) + 'px';
tooltip.style.top = (e.clientY + 10) + 'px';
```

Benefits:

Camera Views:
✅ Save multiple viewpoints
✅ Quick navigation
✅ Presentation mode
✅ Documentation tool
