Add Scale Tracking with Live Dimension Display

Feature: Real-time dimension tracking as scale changes

Backend Changes (app.py):

1. New Endpoint: /get_model_dimensions/<model_id>
   - Loads GLB model with trimesh
   - Calculates bounding box dimensions
   - Converts from meters to centimeters
   - Returns width, height, depth in cm
   - Handles both Scene and Trimesh objects

Frontend Changes (view.html):

1. Dimension Display Section (Transform Panel):
   - Added before Scale slider
   - Shows Width, Height, Depth in cm
   - Gray background box for visibility
   - Theme-aware styling

2. JavaScript Functionality:
   - loadModelDimensions(): Fetches original dimensions on page load
   - updateDimensionDisplay(scale): Updates display when scale changes
   - Integrated with scale slider input event
   - Real-time calculation: original_dimension * scale

User Experience:

Initial State:
- Transform panel opens
- Dimensions load automatically
- Shows original model size

User adjusts scale:
- Slider moves (e.g., 1.0x → 1.5x)
- Dimensions update instantly
- Example: 20cm → 30cm

Save & Export:
- Modified GLB includes scale transform
- Dimensions reflect in saved model
- AR preview shows correct size

Technical Details:

Dimension Calculation:
- GLB units assumed to be meters
- Conversion: meters * 100 = centimeters
- Bounding box: bounds[1] - bounds[0]
- X axis = Width
- Y axis = Height
- Z axis = Depth

Scale Application:
- Uniform scaling (same factor for X, Y, Z)
- Display updates: dimension * scale_factor
- Precision: 1 decimal place (e.g., 25.4 cm)

Benefits:
✅ Users see exact model size
✅ Real-time feedback during scaling
✅ Helps with AR placement planning
✅ Professional dimension tracking
✅ No guesswork needed

Result:
Users can now see and track model dimensions as they adjust scale, making it easy to understand the final size of their model before exporting or viewing in AR.
