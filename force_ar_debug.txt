Add extensive debugging and force AR activation on mobile

Problem:
- AR button still downloading GLB instead of launching AR
- canActivateAR might be returning false
- Need to debug and force activation

Solution:
- Add console.log for all AR-related checks
- Detect mobile devices explicitly
- Force AR activation even if canActivateAR is false
- Add preventDefault and stopPropagation
- Try activateAR() regardless of canActivateAR on mobile

Changes:
- Mobile device detection with user agent
- Extensive console logging for debugging
- Force AR activation on mobile devices
- Graceful fallback to QR modal on error
- Desktop shows QR modal as before

Debug Info:
- Logs: AR button click, model viewer state, canActivateAR value
- Helps identify why AR isn't launching
- Forces AR attempt on mobile even if checks fail

Result:
- Better debugging information in console
- Forced AR activation on mobile
- Should bypass any false negative checks
