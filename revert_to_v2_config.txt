Revert model-viewer to v2 configuration that was working

Problem:
- AR still downloading GLB instead of launching
- Added ar-modes, ar-scale, ios-src but broke functionality
- v2 was working with simpler configuration

Solution:
- Remove ar-modes="webxr scene-viewer quick-look"
- Remove ar-scale="fixed"
- Remove ios-src attribute
- Keep only: ar, ar-placement="floor"
- Match v2's working configuration exactly

v2 Configuration (Working):
- ar (enables AR)
- ar-placement="floor"
- shadow-intensity="1"
- camera-controls
- auto-rotate

Current Configuration (Broken):
- Had extra attributes that broke AR

Result:
- Back to v2's proven working configuration
- Native AR button on mobile
- Custom AR button on desktop
- Should work like v2 did
