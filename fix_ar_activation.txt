Fix AR button to properly activate AR on mobile devices

Problem:
- AR button was downloading model instead of activating AR
- canActivateAR check was not working properly
- No error handling for AR activation

Solution:
- Improve AR detection logic
- Try to activate AR directly with async/await
- Add try-catch error handling
- Fall back to QR modal if AR activation fails
- Better mobile device detection

Changes:
- Enhanced isARSupported() function
- Made AR button click handler async
- Direct activateAR() call on mobile
- Graceful fallback to QR modal
- Console logging for debugging

Result:
- Mobile devices with AR support will launch AR directly
- Desktop/unsupported devices show QR modal
- No more unwanted downloads
- Better user experience
