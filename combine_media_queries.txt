Combine duplicate media queries for mobile CSS

Problem:
- Two separate @media (max-width: 640px) blocks
- Confusing and potentially conflicting styles
- Native AR button still not showing on mobile

Solution:
- Combine the two media queries into one
- Ensure native AR button is not hidden on mobile
- Keep custom AR button hidden on mobile
- Keep color picker hidden on mobile

Result:
- Cleaner, more maintainable CSS
- Less chance of conflicting styles
- Native AR button should now appear on mobile
