Frontend Changes (view.html):

1. Auto-Rotate Toggle Button:
   
   Location: Bottom-right controls (next to screenshot)
   
   HTML:
   ```html
   <button id="autoRotateToggle" class="rounded-full...">
       <svg id="autoRotateIcon">
           <!-- Refresh/rotate icon -->
       </svg>
   </button>
   ```
   
   States:
   - ON (default): White background, normal icon
   - OFF: Red background (bg-red-500), same icon
   
   Functionality:
   - Click to toggle auto-rotate attribute
   - modelViewer.setAttribute('auto-rotate', '') → ON
   - modelViewer.removeAttribute('auto-rotate') → OFF
   - Visual feedback with color change
   - Tooltip updates dynamically

2. Accordion Panel System:
   
   Before (Problem):
   - All 3 panels could be open simultaneously
   - Vertical overflow on smaller screens
   - Panels extended beyond viewport
   - Poor UX when all open
   
   After (Solution):
   - Only 1 panel open at a time
   - Click panel → Opens and closes others
   - Click same panel → Closes it (toggle)
   - No overflow issues
   - Clean, organized interface
   
   Implementation:
   ```javascript
   const allPanelIds = ['materialPanel', 'transformPanel', 'annotationsPanel'];
   
   function togglePanel(panelId) {
       const isCurrentlyOpen = !panel.classList.contains('hidden');
       
       // Close all panels first
       allPanelIds.forEach(id => {
           closePanel(id);
       });
       
       // Open clicked panel if it was closed
       if (!isCurrentlyOpen) {
           openPanel(panelId);
       }
   }
   ```

3. Smooth Transitions:
   
   CSS Added:
   ```css
   .panel-content {
       transition: max-height 0.3s ease-in-out, 
                   opacity 0.3s ease-in-out;
       overflow: hidden;
   }
   
   .panel-content.hidden {
       max-height: 0 !important;
       opacity: 0;
   }
   
   .panel-header svg {
       transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
   }
   ```
   
   Effects:
   - Smooth panel open/close
   - Icon rotation animation
   - Opacity fade in/out
   - Professional feel

Benefits:

Auto-Rotate Toggle:

Technical Details:

Auto-Rotate:

- Toggle removes/adds attribute
- No performance impact
- Instant response

Accordion:
- JavaScript-based panel management
- Array of panel IDs for easy maintenance
- Close all → Open one pattern
- Prevents multiple panels open
- CSS transitions for smoothness

Button Layout:
```
Bottom-Right Controls (left to right):
1. AR Button
2. QR Button
3. Screenshot Button
4. Auto-Rotate Toggle ← NEW!
5. Download Button
6. Fullscreen Button

```

Visual Feedback:

Auto-Rotate States:
```
ON:  ⟳ (white background)
OFF: ⟳ (red background)
```

Panel Icons:
```
Closed: ▼ (arrow down)
Open:   ▲ (arrow up, rotated 180°)
```

Responsive Design:
- Auto-rotate button: Same size as other controls
- Panels: Hidden on mobile (< 640px)
- Accordion: Works on all screen sizes
- Transitions: Smooth on all devices

Accessibility:
- Clear tooltips for auto-rotate
- Visual state indicators
- Smooth, predictable animations

Result:
Users now have full control over model rotation and a clean, organized panel interface that prevents overflow and provides a professional, smooth user experience. The accordion layout ensures only one panel is open at a time, making the interface cleaner and more focused.
