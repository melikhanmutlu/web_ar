## AI-Powered Code Review Automation

### Automated Code Review Workflow

#### Initial Triage
1. Parse diff to determine modified files and affected components
2. Match file types to optimal static analysis tools
3. Scale analysis based on PR size (superficial >1000 lines, deep <200 lines)
4. Classify change type: feature, bug fix, refactoring, or breaking change

#### Multi-Tool Static Analysis (Execute in Parallel)
- **CodeQL**: Deep vulnerability analysis (SQL injection, XSS, auth bypasses)
- **SonarQube**: Code smells, complexity, duplication, maintainability
- **Semgrep**: Organization-specific rules and security policies
- **Snyk/Dependabot**: Supply chain security
- **GitGuardian/TruffleHog**: Secret detection

#### Model Selection for AI Review
- **Fast reviews (<200 lines)**: GPT-4o-mini or Claude Haiku
- **Deep reasoning**: Claude Sonnet or GPT-5 (200K+ tokens)
- **Code generation**: GitHub Copilot or Qodo
- **Multi-language**: Qodo or CodeAnt AI (30+ languages)

#### Review Routing Strategy
- PRs >50 files or >1000 lines: Require human review
- Security-sensitive changes: Use high-capability models with security-focused prompts
- Test coverage gaps >20%: Route to test-generation tooling
- Standard changes: Use fast, cost-effective models

### OWASP Top 10 Quick Reference
1. **A01 - Broken Access Control**: Missing authorization, IDOR
2. **A02 - Cryptographic Failures**: Weak hashing, insecure RNG
3. **A03 - Injection**: SQL, NoSQL, command injection via taint analysis
4. **A04 - Insecure Design**: Missing threat modeling
5. **A05 - Security Misconfiguration**: Default credentials
6. **A06 - Vulnerable Components**: Snyk/Dependabot for CVEs
7. **A07 - Authentication Failures**: Weak session management
8. **A08 - Data Integrity Failures**: Unsigned JWTs
9. **A09 - Logging Failures**: Missing audit logs
10. **A10 - SSRF**: Unvalidated user-controlled URLs

### Scalability Red Flags
- N+1 Queries, Missing Indexes, Synchronous External Calls
- In-Memory State, Unbounded Collections, Missing Pagination
- No Connection Pooling, No Rate Limiting

### Structured Review Comment Format
```typescript
interface ReviewComment {
  path: string; line: number;
  severity: 'CRITICAL' | 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW' | 'INFO';
  category: 'Security' | 'Performance' | 'Bug' | 'Maintainability';
  title: string; description: string;
  codeExample?: string; references?: string[];
  autoFixable: boolean; cwe?: string; cvss?: number;
  effort: 'trivial' | 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
}
```
